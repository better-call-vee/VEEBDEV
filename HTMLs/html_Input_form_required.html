    <title>Required Attribute Note</title>
    <!-- 
    Overview:
    - The "required" attribute is a boolean attribute that forces users to fill out a form field before submission.
    
    Usage:
    - Add the "required" attribute to <input>, <select>, or <textarea> elements.
    - It triggers native browser validation, preventing form submission if the field is empty.
    
    Syntax Example:
    <input type="text" name="username" required>
    
    Key Points:
    1. Boolean Attribute: Its presence means true; no value is needed.
    2. Enhances UX: Provides immediate feedback for missing information.
    3. Always combine with server-side validation for security.

<!-- 
Native Validation Trigger:
     - Browser's built-in validation (including the 'required' attribute)
       is triggered when a form submission event occurs.
     - The <form> element defines the context for input fields to be validated.

Without the <form> Element:
     - Input elements not wrapped inside a <form> are not part of a form submission process.
     - As a result, native validation (like enforcing 'required') doesn't get triggered.
     - There's no submission event to check if fields are filled out.
