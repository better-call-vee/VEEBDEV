// GET Method
// Imagine you're a spy named GET who secretly retrieves information without changing anything.
// GET requests fetch data from servers without altering resources.
// Ex: Viewing profiles, checking posts.

// POST Method
// POST is like your favorite delivery service; it sends new packages (data) safely to your database.
// Primarily used to add new resources.
// Ex: Signing up, creating a new tweet, adding a blog.

// PATCH Method
// PATCH acts like a mechanic who repairs only what's broken in your car (resource).
// Updates partial information of existing resources.
// Ex: Updating just your profile picture.

// PUT Method
// PUT replaces the entire car even if you just had a broken mirror.
// Fully replaces an existing resource or creates it if not existing.
// Ex: Completely updating your entire profile details.

// DELETE Method
// DELETE is the assassin that permanently removes resources from existence.
// Ex: Deleting your embarrassing old tweets.

// CRUD Operations
// CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete
// - CREATE: POST (Add resources)
// - READ: GET (Fetch resources)
// - UPDATE: PUT/PATCH (Modify resources)
// - DELETE: DELETE (Remove resources)

// GET vs POST
// - GET requests data, doesn't change server data, data is sent in URL (visible, not secure).
// - POST submits data, can change server data, data sent securely in request body (hidden).

// JSON_PLACEHOLDER
// Fake REST API for practice/testing HTTP requests.
// Provides dummy endpoints (users, posts, todos, etc.).

// REST API Methods
// REST (Representational State Transfer) uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE) to interact with
resources on servers.

// HTTP Status Codes
// Imagine status codes as reactions when you ask a favor:
// 200 - OK: "Sure, here it is!" (Request successful)
// 301 - Moved Permanently: "I moved, here's my new address." (Resource relocated permanently)
// 302 - Found: "Temporary move, check there." (Resource temporarily redirected)
// 404 - Not Found: "Never heard of it." (Resource doesn't exist)
// 500 - Internal Server Error: "Oops! Server issue." (Server-side error)
// 503 - Service Unavailable: "Busy now, try later." (Server temporarily unavailable)
