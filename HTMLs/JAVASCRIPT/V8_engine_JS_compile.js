// V8 Engine Internal Mechanism and its Relation with JavaScript

// The V8 engine is like a high-performance car engine for JavaScript. It's what allows JavaScript to run efficiently in environments
// like Google Chrome or Node.js. It's written in C++, which allows it to perform incredibly fast computations and optimize the execution of JavaScript code.


// V8 Written in C++
// V8 is developed in C++, a language that compiles directly to machine code, allowing the engine to execute JavaScript code much faster than if it
// were written in higher-level languages. This gives V8 the power to convert JavaScript code into optimized machine code, which runs quickly on the processor.


// How V8 Makes JavaScript Run - The Steps
// When you write JavaScript, it needs to be processed and executed. Here's how V8 handles this process:

// 1. Parsing the Code
// When JavaScript code is fed into the V8 engine, the first thing that happens is **parsing**. V8 reads the code line by line and
// checks its syntax to ensure there are no errors. If there’s an error, it will stop here and report the issue.
// The result of this step is the **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, which represents the structure of the code in a way that the engine
// can understand.


// 2. Generating the Syntax Tree
// The syntax tree is a tree-like structure where each node represents a construct in the code (e.g., variables, functions, operations).
// It’s a structured representation of the source code, which makes it easier for V8 to understand the logic and flow of the program.


// 3. Converting to Bytecode
// Once the AST is generated, V8 converts it into **bytecode**. Bytecode is an intermediate representation of the code that’s
// optimized for quick execution. It's a low-level code that's closer to machine code, but not yet fully compiled. This allows V8
// to execute it more efficiently than interpreting the original JavaScript source code directly.

// 4. Feedback and Optimizations
// V8 doesn’t just stop at bytecode; it continuously gathers **feedback** during execution. It tracks the performance of the code
// (e.g., which parts of the code are used most frequently) and uses this data to optimize the bytecode further. The more V8 runs
// the code, the more feedback it gathers, allowing it to perform even better over time.

// V8 uses techniques like **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**, where parts of the bytecode are compiled into machine code at runtime
// for faster execution. This makes V8 highly dynamic and adaptable to different use cases, optimizing execution as the program runs.


// 5. Final Compilation and Running the Code
// After feedback and optimizations are applied, V8 **compiles** the code into **machine code** (native code), which the computer's
// processor can execute directly. This final step makes the code run at top performance because it's now fully optimized for the system.


// V8 Inside Google Chrome
// V8 is an integral part of **Google Chrome**, which is why JavaScript runs so fast in the browser. Chrome uses V8 to handle JavaScript
// execution when you load a webpage, ensuring that all the dynamic content, interactivity, and animations work smoothly and quickly.


// V8 is Open Source
// The V8 engine is **open source**, meaning anyone can access and contribute to its development. This has led to a wide variety of improvements,
// optimizations, and support for new JavaScript features, making V8 one of the most efficient JavaScript engines in use today.


// The Entire Flow (JS -> Parse -> Syntax Tree -> Bytecode -> Feedback -> Optimization and Compile -> Run the Code)
// Here's the summary of the entire process:

// 1. **JS Code**: You write JavaScript code.
// 2. **Parse**: V8 parses the code and checks its syntax.
// 3. **Syntax Tree**: The code is converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), a structured representation.
// 4. **Bytecode**: V8 then generates bytecode, which is an intermediate representation optimized for execution.
// 5. **Feedback**: V8 gathers runtime feedback and uses it to optimize the execution further.
// 6. **Optimization and Compile**: V8 compiles frequently used parts of the bytecode into highly optimized machine code using JIT compilation.
// 7. **Run the Code**: The optimized machine code is executed by the computer’s processor, running your JavaScript code as efficiently as possible.
