Steps to Set Up a Live Website on GitHub Pages:

1. **Set Up Your Repository:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub or use an existing one.
   - Add your project files, including an `index.html` file (the main entry point for your website).

2. **Ensure `index.html` is in the Root Directory:**
   - The `index.html` file must be in the root of your repository.
   - If it’s in a folder (e.g., `/HTMLs`), move it to the root directory. You can do this:
     - Locally: Move the file manually and push the changes.
     - On GitHub: Edit the repository structure using the web interface.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under "Source," select:
     - Branch: `main` (or your default branch).
     - Folder: `/root` (if the file is in the root directory).
   - Click **Save**.

4. **Generate the Live Link:**
   - Once GitHub Pages is enabled, GitHub will provide a live link to your website.
   - The link will look like this:
     ```
     https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
     ```
   - Example: 
     [https://better-call-vee.github.io/VEEBDEV/](https://better-call-vee.github.io/VEEBDEV/)

5. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - It may take a few minutes for your website to go live. Refresh the link if it doesn’t work immediately.

6. **Verify Your Website:**
   - Open the link provided by GitHub Pages.
   - Ensure that your `index.html` and other assets (CSS, JS) load correctly.

---

**Important Notes:**
- `index.html` is mandatory for GitHub Pages to recognize your website's homepage.
- The live link will always use the format `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
- For a custom domain, configure your DNS settings and add the domain in the GitHub Pages settings.
