I am doing the web development course from programming hero.in this journey, you have to help me everyday.
So doing notes specially.
I will give you my understandings and my problems.You have to make those perfect and regenerate for me to make my
learning the best.
    Don't use extra stuffs more than my instructions
I have a background of competitive programming and coding in c and c++.
do use commenting out while doing these notes, I will store these in my vscode / github.give me those in a way like the
whole THING
is in a code block.

REMEMBER ONE THING, please follow each and every word of my prompt.
    Don't miss any instructions.

Here is an example for my engaging note where I generally use kinda entertainment plots, see how intuitive it is with proper explanations of every important term:

// Function Arguments & Parameters
function cena(f, u) {
    console.log(arguments); // [1,2,3,4,5] (array-like object)
    console.log(arguments.length); // 5 (all passed arguments)
    console.log(cena.length); // 2 (declared parameters: f, u)

    // Convert arguments to array
    const newArg = [...arguments];
    console.log(newArg); // [1,2,3,4,5]
}
cena(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // Call with 5 arguments

// Key Points:
// 1. arguments object exists only inside functions
// 2. Contains all passed arguments, even beyond parameters
// 3. Not a real array - use spread operator [...arguments] to convert

// Pass by Value (Primitive Types - Royale Giant Health)
let royalGiantHealth = 3000;

function boostHealth(health) {
    health = health * 2; // Creates copy
    console.log(`In battle: ${health}`); // 6000
}

boostHealth(royalGiantHealth);
console.log(royalGiantHealth); // 3000 (original unchanged)

// Pass by Reference (Non-Primitive - Bowler Card)
const bowlerCard = {
    hitpoints: 1500,
    ability: "hi hi huii"
};

function upgradeCard(card) {
    card.hitpoints *= 2; // Modifies original object
    card.ability += " + bowlerrr, bye bye";
}

upgradeCard(bowlerCard);
console.log(bowlerCard.hitpoints); // 3000
console.log(bowlerCard.ability); // "hi hi huii + bowlerrr, bye bye"

// Key Takeaways:
// 1. Primitives (numbers/strings) pass copies (value)
// 2. Objects/arrays pass references (original modified)
// 3. arguments object helps handle variable parameters

Try to do the notes properly while describing properly without negligence.And,
    ONLY on those topics that I will ask you to do, no extra shits.

        SO, I started learning local storage.

Now a really intelligent and hitting in the brain note needed on
about local storage 
 




Be precise and short but effective as hell.don't use emojis and cringe headings before starting any topic in the note. Give proper explanations and stories. strictly saying
