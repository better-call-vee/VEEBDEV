/*
 * Client (user) sends a request via the API (waiter),
 * API delivers it to the Server (kitchen),
 * Server processes it using Data (ingredients),
 * and the API returns the response (meal) back to the Client.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The Server is like a chef—it processes requests and handles logic.
 * The Database is like the pantry—it stores and provides raw data.
 * The Server queries the Database to fetch or update data as needed.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The Client sends a Request to the Server (like placing an order).
 * The Server processes it and sends back a Response (like serving a meal).
 * This communication happens over the internet using protocols like HTTP.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The API is a bridge between the Client and Server.
 * The Client sends HTTP Requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) via the API.
 * These map to CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
 * The Server receives the request, interacts with the Database if needed,
 * and sends back a Response through the API to the Client.
